11/10/2000
----------

+ Rewrote request handler and filename creation routines

+ Fixed content-type handling bug (comparison was reversed)

+ Server now chdir()'s to DOCUMENT_ROOT on startup rather than
	having to splice it with the GET URL on every request.

11/9/2000
---------

+ Syntactic cleanups

+ Changed license from GPL to public domain

9/3/2000
--------

+ Replaced strncasecmp with internal (portable) streq_case function

+ Cached strlen of DOCUMENT_ROOT
 

9/1/2000
--------

+ Replaced COPYING with a URL

+ Added minimal HTTP handling. Returns an HTTP OK header if the client
	specifies GET foo HTTP, along with Content-type: foo/bar

+ Added content table handler. Only returns documents that it understands
	the type of, in light of absent security features like .htaccess.
	Also allows for accurate Content-type header
